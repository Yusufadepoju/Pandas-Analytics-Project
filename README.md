# Company XYZ Supermarket Data Analysis

To-Do - Write a short project description here.
Company XYZ owns a supermarket chain across the country. Each major branch located in 3 cities across the country recorded sales information for 3 months, to help the company understand sales trends and determine its growth, as the rise of supermarkets competition is seen to increase.

The data folder contains datasets from three different branches; Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt. Each data file from the branches contains the same attribute information and see below the attribute description. 

# Project Steps

To-Do - Explain in detail, the project steps and overview of different tasks completed here.
Some of the skillset used to solve this problem
1) Data Gathering: The Dataset consist of 3 tables
2) Data Cleaning (Wrangling): This was done effectively, the process involved converting data appropiate data type 
3) Exploratory Data Analysis: I explored the dataset to reveal hidden insights to the stakeholders requirements (More details in the github repo)
5) Data Visualization: A report was created using seaborn to visualize the insights to the stakeholders
6) Documentation: I documented each step and each process I used to tackle the problems for Company XYZ

# Insights

To-Do - Explain the insights you were able to uncover from the analysing the datasets.
